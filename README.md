# From a Wikipedia page summarize the text and get a list of facts using GPT3.

## THE MOTIVATION

The proposed solution to GPT3's susceptibility to generating inaccurate or misleading information is to create a factual base that serves as the context for any query. This base would be developed by crafting a list of factual statements from a Wikipedia page and must be carefully reviewed and revised by humans for accuracy. This would provide the AI with a reliable source of data that can use to more accurately respond to the query.

## IMPLEMENTATION

This code is part of the overall implementation and focusing on the part of extracting the relevant information from a Wikipedia page. To reduce the size of the text, it is first summarized into sections and then the list of facts is extracted. In future projects, a fact base will be created which extracts embeddings, stores the data in a database, and allows for human revision and addition of facts to support potential user queries. By using this method, users can be sure that the results provided by the AI are both accurate and reliable.

## RESULTS

The following is the result of finding 20 facts for the Wikipedia page of ‘Guillermo Cabrera Infante’ an important Cuban writer.

1. Guillermo Cabrera Infante was born in 1941 in Gibara, Cuba. 
2. He moved to Havana with his parents at the age of six. 
3. Cabrera Infante studied journalism at the University of Havana. 
4. He became the editor of the magazine Carteles in 1957. 
5. Cabrera Infante divorced his first wife in 1961 and married his second wife, Miriam Gomez, an actress. 
6. He served as a cultural attaché in Brussels, Belgium, from 1962 to 1965. 
7. He went into exile in Madrid in 1965 and then London in 1966. 
8. Cabrera Infante published Tres tristes tigres, a highly experimental, Joycean novel, in 1966. 
9. He co-wrote the script for Richard C. Sarafian's 1971 cult film Vanishing Point under the pseudonym Guillermo Caín. 
10. Cabrera Infante was influential to Puerto Rican and Cuban writers such as Luis Rafael Sánchez (La guaracha del Macho Camacho) and Fernando Velázquez Medina (Última rumba en La Habana). 
11. In 1997 he received the Premio Cervantes, presented to him by King Juan Carlos of Spain. 
12. Cabrera Infante died on February 21, 2005, in London, of sepsis. 
13. He is best known for his novel Tres tristes tigres, which was later republished as Ella Cantaba Boleros. 
14. Cabrera Infante also wrote a number of other novels, short stories, and essays. 
15. His work is considered to be highly experimental and avant-garde. 
16. Cabrera Infante was a member of the Cuban Communist Party. 
17. He was critical of the Castro regime and its treatment of writers and intellectuals. 
18. Cabrera Infante was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the highest honor given to a Spanish-language writer, in 1997. 
19. He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004. 
20. Cabrera Infante died in London in 2005 at the age of 74.

As we can see it extracted very relevant facts from the text that could be used to complement further queries where this person might appear. At the same time is important to notice the need for human revision. For example, the sentence: Cabrera Infante was a member of the Cuban Communist Party is false as well as another couple more. Correcting these issues is necessary but also it provides adversarial information that could be use to reinforce the reliability of the response.

## CONCLUSIONS

It might be argued that if humans must revise the text generated by GPT3 why get it in the first place. Automatic generating a factual list for every Wikipedia page that we might consider is an advantage in producing a final revised result because it reduces large portion of the work.
In GPT4, despite its improvements, there seams to be necessary to have this database of facts. The only difference is that since it will accept larger text as context we could use the entire Wikipedia page to get list instead of summarizing pieces of them.
